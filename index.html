                    <h3>1955 - Born in San Francisco</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California, Steven Paul Jobs was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, a middle-class couple who moved to the Silicon Valley area when he was still young. Growing up in a neighborhood filled with engineers working on electronics and other gadgets in their garages on weekends, Jobs developed a keen interest in the field. At age 13, he met Stephen Wozniak, an electronics expert who would become a significant influence in his life.</p>

                    <h3>1974 - Worked at Atari as a game developer</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>When Steve Jobs was of college age, he expressed his desire to attend Reed College in Oregon to his parents. Despite the exorbitant tuition fees, his parents had promised his biological parents that he would receive a college education, so they acquiesced. However, after just one semester, Steve dropped out as he was more interested in eastern philosophy, fruitarian diets, and LSD than his classes. He moved to a hippie commune in Oregon where he spent his time growing apples. After a few months, Steve returned to California and found a job at Atari. He used his earnings to travel to India with his college friend, Dan Kottke, in search of enlightenment. Upon his return, Steve became more interested in his friend Woz's new endeavors.</p>

                    <h3>1976 - Apple was founded</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Woz was highly interested in electronics and regularly attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club, a group of early computer hobbyists who gathered to showcase their personal computer creations and software. The club gained popularity after the release of the Altair 8800 personal computer kit in 1975. With the knowledge he gained from these meetings and his exceptional talent, Woz was able to build his own computer board for personal use. Steve Jobs recognized the potential of Woz's invention and convinced him to start a company, which led to the birth of Apple Computer in April 1976. They spent the following months assembling and selling Apple I computers from Jobs' garage. Wozniak had already started work on the more powerful and expandable Apple II computer, which Jobs sought venture capital for. Former Intel executive Mike Markkula eventually invested $250,000 in January 1977 and predicted that Apple would join the Fortune 500 in less than two years thanks to the success of the Apple II.</p>

                    <h3>1980 - Apple gained a market value of $1.2 Billion</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>After achieving great success, Apple's leaders determined that it was appropriate to become a public company. The initial public offering occurred in December 1980, just four years after the firm's establishment. At the age of 25, Steve Jobs' net worth skyrocketed to over $200 million.</p>

                    <h3>1984 - The arrival of the Macintosh personal computer</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Due to his quick temper and limited management experience, Steve Jobs clashed with the Lisa leadership team and was subsequently removed from the project. This was a devastating blow for him. Seeking revenge, he took charge of a smaller project known as Macintosh, which was intended to be an affordable and user-friendly personal computer. In 1981, Jobs became the head of the Macintosh project and aimed to make it a more compact and cost-effective version of the Lisa, featuring a graphical user interface with folders, icons, drop-down menus, and a mouse.</p>

                    <h3>1985 - Steve Jobs left Apple</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh to great success after a memorable TV commercial during the Super Bowl. However, as the PC industry fell into a slump in early 1985, Mac sales plummeted. Despite this, Steve Jobs refused to acknowledge the issue and tensions arose between him and CEO John Sculley. In May 1985, Jobs attempted to convince directors and executives that Sculley should be removed, but instead, Sculley took the matter to the board of directors who sided with him. Jobs was left with no operational duties and was only to remain chairman of the board. Feeling betrayed, Jobs spent four months traveling and eventually returned with a plan to start a new computer company aimed at higher education. When Apple learned of this, they threatened to sue him for taking valuable information. Jobs resigned and sold his Apple shares, going ahead with his plan to incorporate NeXT. Apple later dropped the lawsuit.</p>

                    <h3>1986 - Steve bought Pixar Animation Studios</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>During his divorce proceedings, George Lucas decided to sell the computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company. Steve Jobs, who had recently sold all his Apple stocks and had a substantial amount of money, expressed interest in purchasing the division. In 1986, Jobs acquired the division and formed a new company called Pixar. The founders of Pixar, Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, shared a vision of creating films solely using computer animation, but knew that existing technology was not advanced enough to make it possible. They patiently waited for decades until their dream could become a reality.</p>

                    <h3>1997 - The return to Apple</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>Apple faced challenges in the business world after Steve Jobs left the company. Despite the success of the Macintosh and its successors, sales declined sharply in 1995 after the release of Microsoft's Windows 95, which imitated the Mac OS GUI. In 1996, new CEO Gil Amelio was brought in to turn things around. He cut costs and decided to acquire an operating system instead of creating one from scratch, ultimately choosing NeXTSTEP for $400 million. This decision brought Steve Jobs back to Apple, but Amelio's tenure was short-lived as the company lost $700 million in the first quarter of 1997, resulting in his departure. Jobs then orchestrated a board coup and became Apple's interim CEO in September 1997 after making a deal with Microsoft to settle patent disputes and invest $150 million in the company.</p>

                    <h3>2006 - Pixar merges with Walt Disney</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>The success of the iPod played a role in the future of Pixar, Steve Jobs' other company. After producing numerous successful films, Pixar decided to end their distribution deal with Disney due to tensions between Jobs and Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Jobs refused to make another deal with Disney until Eisner was replaced, which was supported by other Disney executives, including Walt's nephew, Roy Disney. This ultimately led to Bob Iger becoming the new CEO in 2005. Iger reached out to Jobs to end the Pixar-Disney dispute, and during their conversation, Jobs pitched his plan for an iPod with video capabilities and a movie store. Iger agreed, and they announced the sale of TV shows on the iTunes Store in 2005. Shortly after, Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion, making Jobs a Disney board member and the largest individual shareholder. Pixar executives Ed Catmull and John Lasseter were also given leadership roles in the new combined animation studio. This acquisition was similar to NeXT taking over Apple after the 1996 merger.</p>

                </summary>
                <p>The year 2007 was the year of iPhone. Steve Jobs unveiled it at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco on January 9. The first Apple smartphone had very limited functionality (including not being able to connect to the Internet independently of Wi Fi). For many experts this meant it was effectively an entire computer that just happened to make phone calls.

                <p>iPod sales peaked at four billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 2008. In all of 2008, a total of 54.83 million iPods were sold.</p>

                </summary>
                <p>When Steve Jobs' cancer returned, he knew it was time to make arrangements for his passing. He took steps to ensure that Apple would continue to operate successfully without him, including creating "Apple University" to groom future executives and selecting Tim Cook as his successor. He also unveiled plans for the new Apple Park campus. Jobs also prepared his personal legacy, granting interviews for his authorized biography and designing a yacht for his family. His passing came shortly after the introduction of the iPhone 4S, and he died peacefully at home surrounded by loved ones.</p>

            <h5 id="further-links-header">Check out more of the most influential people in the tech world</h5>
            <p id="further-links-description" class="margin-sides">Technology has been an integral part of human existence since prehistoric times. From controlling fire to inventing the wheel and the modern term "technology" after the second Industrial Revolution, tools, communication, clothing, housing, transportation, weapons, and more all rely on technology. Technology news plays a significant role in our daily lives and development, and some famous tech figures have played crucial roles in advancing it.
                <br><br>
                However, it can be challenging to determine who the most influential figure in technology is, as many Silicon Valley leaders have contributed significantly to every aspect of our lives. Nevertheless, some individuals have made significant contributions to the tech industry, rejuvenating existing successes and achieving major tech milestones. This list focuses on famous tech people behind materialized innovations and those closely associated with significant tech achievements.
