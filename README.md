## Design

### WireFrames: 

### Colour Scheme:

<div align="left">
    <img src="assets/images/coolers-colour-scheme.png" alt="Colour scheme made on coolors.co website" style="height:300px;">
</div>

The colour scheme used in this project is a monochromatic colour scheme. It consists of shades of black, grey, and blue. 

The primary colour used is black (#000000), which represents elegance, sophistication, and power. It is used as the background colour to provide a neutral and timeless base for the other colours to stand out.

The secondary colour used is dark grey (#24252A), which adds depth and contrast to the design. It is used to highlight important elements and create a visual hierarchy.

The tertiary colour used is light blue (#a8a8fa), which adds a touch of colour and liveliness to the design. It represents creativity, innovation, and technology, which are all values associated with Steve Jobs.

The accent colour used is light grey (#c8c8c8), which is a softer version of the dark grey. It is used to create a subtle contrast and add texture to the design.

Finally, white (#ffffff) is used as the contrasting colour to ensure readability and legibility and give it that crisp and proffesional feel.

Overall, this colour scheme was chosen to create a sleek, modern, and sophisticated design that reflects Steve Jobs' impact on the world of technology.


### Typography: 

For this project I used the fonts Alata and Robot Slab for their unique and modern styles that fit well with the tribute page's sleek and sophisticated design. This will fall in line with many of the apple products which have time and time again proven to be sleek and sophisticated

<div align="left">
    <img src="assets/images/alata-eg.png" alt="Alata font example" style="height:100px;">
    <p>Alata is a sans-serif font that is bold and geometric, making it perfect for headlines and titles. Its clean and modern style adds a touch of elegance to the design while also being easy to read. We used Alata for the main headings on the tribute page to create a strong visual impact.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/roboto-slab-eg.png" alt="Roboto Slab font example" style="height:100px;">
    <p>Robot Slab, on the other hand, is a slab serif font that has a more traditional and classic feel. Its thick and sturdy lines make it perfect for body text and smaller headings. We used Robot Slab for the main body text on the tribute page to ensure readability and legibility.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/apple-ionicon-logo.png" alt="Apple logo font used as part of CSS art" style="height:100px;">
    <p>Additionally, we used the Ionicons website to access the Apple computer logo font. This font is a custom-designed typeface that is used exclusively by Apple and is not available for public use. However, the Ionicons website provides a collection of icons and logos, including the Apple computer logo, that are free to use for personal projects. We used the Apple computer logo font to create a visual connection between Steve Jobs and Apple, as he was one of the co-founders and played a significant role in the company's success. Using this font helped to reinforce the tribute page's focus on Steve Jobs' contributions to the tech industry and his legacy.</p>
</div>

### Imagery:

The imagery used on this website includes photos geared towards Steve Jobs, Apple products and Pixar. These images are used to provide visual interest and enhance the user experience.

#### Standardised Header/Nav Bar

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/header-nav-eg.png" alt="Standardised header across all pages of the site" style="height:100px;">
</div>

The header/nav bar and footer are standardized across all pages of the website to provide consistency and ease of navigation for the user. The header has a reduced opacity as I felt is was more stylish and innovative to fall in line with Apple products and everything that Steve Jobs was involved in.

The nav bar includes two options: "Home" which takes the user to a scrolling page of five main sections, and "Contact Me" which takes the user to a page where they can submit a message to the website creator aswell as the logo, on the left, which will take the user to the Bowles full stack git hub page.

The logo is shown as an abstract letter B, that can be rotated 180 degrees and look like the letter B but in a different format, as well as a "Stack" of objects to represent several programming languages, again can be rotated 180 degrees and will show a different set or "Stack" of languages. The logo colour has been modified to tie in with the pages aesthetics.

#### Standardised Footer

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/footer-eg.png" alt="Standardised footer across all pages of the site" style="height:250px;">
</div>

A standardized footer is used to provide consistency across all pages of a website. It includes important information such as contact details, thank you and brief summary of why I chose this topic. 

A standardized footer can help to improve the overall user experience by providing a sense of familiarity and making the site easier to use. Overall, a standardized footer is an important design element.

#### Images and Initial Load Aesthetic

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/on-load-index.png" alt="view of the index page on first laoding the site shows clean and crisp look" style="height:450px;">
</div>

The initial loading of the Steve Jobs tribute page is designed to create a crisp and elegant aesthetic that symbolizes the starting point of Steve Jobs' career and his advances in technology. The page features a monochromatic color scheme with shades of black, grey, and the small hint of blue in the logo, which represents sophistication, power, and creativity. Overall, the initial loading of the page sets the tone for the rest of the tribute which progresses and develops into more colour and more wow factor.

  </p>
</div>

Unsplash is a website that provides free high-quality images that can be used for personal or commercial projects.

  </p>
</div>

Using Unsplash images in my project saved time and eliminated cost or the need to purchase licensed images. 

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/thumbsup.png" alt="Man giving two thumbs up close to camera lense" style="height:250px;">

  </p>
</div>

Additionally, Unsplash images are often visually stunning and can add a professional and polished look to a project. Using Unsplash images enhanced the visual appeal of my project while also saving time and resources.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/apple-logo-droplet.png" alt="Apple logo inside a waterdroplet CSS art with shadows and highlights" style="height:250px;">
    <p>This wa taken from a youtube tutorial!<br>BUT<br>I completed the tutorial before starting this project and did not re follow it line by line when implimenting it here, I started off referencing how it was structured with the container, the ::before and ::after for the reflections/highlights and continued on my own styling it in my own way</p>
</div>

I left this in my project even though it was from a youtube tutorial as I feel like some things started to click for me with CSS and was a bit of a personal milestone. I changed things such as shape of droplet, highlights/shadows. i had changed the icon but reverted to the ionicon as i was unsure on copyright with using a genuine apple logo"

#### Wikipedia Images and Links

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/further-link-screengrab.png" alt="collection of links to 6 major technology leaders" style="height:250px;">
    <p>pictures used in this section are taken from the wikipedia pages that they are anchored to and will be referenced in the credits section below</p>
</div>

### Page Flow

#### Main Scrolling Page

This is the main page and consits of many major sections.

The flow is designed to start on load with an elegant monotone colour scheme and as the user begins to scroll they discover more colour, features, information and excitement. This symbolises the advancements in technology that has been seen over Steve Jobs lifetime.

<details>
<summary>Index Page Screenshots as whole project</summary>
<br>
  <div align="center">
      <img src="assets/images/index-screenshot-1.png" alt="Screenshot of index page" style="width:500px; display:block">
      <img src="assets/images/index-screenshot-2.png" alt="Screenshot of index page" style="width:500px; display:block">
      <img src="assets/images/index-screenshot-3.png" alt="Screenshot of index page" style="width:500px; display:block">
      <img src="assets/images/index-screenshot-4.png" alt="Screenshot of index page" style="width:500px; display:block">
  </div>
</details>  

<details>
<summary>Index Page Flow: Broken down into sections</summary>

* Header/Nav Bar, nav elements are in the top right designed for the mobile first approach, this perfect placement for users thumbs to press aswell as where eyes are drawn to. the space between links is sufficent for even clumsy users.

* Image and title to instantly let users understand the page intent

* Brief summary about Steve Jobs

* Audio file and transcript link so users can understand more about Steve jobs

* Vibrant image to showcase Pixar Film and break up the sections with a design element

* Milestones advances from brief overviews to now giving the choice of headings or full information, the details summary use gives the user both interaction and control over navigating the timeline of events and what specific information they wish view

* Waterdrop design element breaks up the sections and symbolises advancements in technology by showcasing CSS art rather than pre made images

* Testimonials sections shows the love that people feel for Steve Jobs, allowing the user to feel the same

* The "Further Links" description provides a sufficient explanation to enlighten users on the ongoing advancements in technology, this will motivate them to take action.

* Further links section has contemporary style headings on the links that are slightly offset to the left, pictures with rounded edges and :hover styles with big shadows showing the diversity of technology today

* Footer has a contrasted background to the rest fo the project as i wanted to show that it was the and of the page and also that it contained different type of information, it contains my information.

</details>

#### Contact & Thank You Pages

The Contact/ Thank You page did not fit in the flow of the main scrolling page so it was designed to stand alone. The header and footer were the same and the hero image has an Apple logo to keep continuity and familiarity with the website itself

<details>
<summary>Contact Page Screenshot</summary>
<br>
  <div align="center">
      <img src="assets/images/contact-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of contact page" style="width:500px;">
  </div>
</details>

The contact page is designed for the user to give feedback, interesting features here include spambot checker a thank you message on completion and this form actually works by sending myself an email by using formsubmit.io

<details>
<summary>Thank you Page Screenshot</summary>
<br>
  <div align="center">
      <img src="assets/images/thanks-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of thanks page" style="width:500px;">
  </div>
</details>

I wanted this to be fun and show a lighthearted thank you, as I am using Formsubmit.io I had to redirect from their own "your form has been submitted page" as it had no return links as well as no continuity with the site branding

#### 404 Page

The header and footer were the same and the hero image has an old looking computer monitor to keep continuity and familiarity with the website itself

<details>
<summary>404 Page Screenshot</summary>
<br>
  <div align="center">
      <img src="assets/images/404-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of 404 page" style="width:500px;">
  </div>
</details>

I thought the image fit very well with the theme and what the page symbolised. the return links are there to redirect users back to the pages that are known to work.
